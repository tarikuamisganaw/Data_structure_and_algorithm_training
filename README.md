# Graph and Heap Implementation in Python

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of a max-heap and a graph using an adjacency list,including heap operations and graph traversals.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Max-Heapify Implementation
- Implemented the max-heapify function verbatim from the provided slides.
- Developed an iterative version of max-heapify as per task specifications.

### 2. Heap Operations
- Created a heapify function that transforms a list into heap order.
- Researched and implemented a sorting mechanism using heapsort based on the heap operations.

### 3. Graph Implementation
- Designed a Graph class and a Node class to model a graph using an adjacency list.
- Parsed data from cities.txt to build the graph dynamically.

### 4. Search Algorithms
- Implemented both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithms.
- The DFS implementation features a recursive approach and prints the path between two specified cities.

## Features
- Efficient data structure implementation for heaps and graphs.
- Clear separation of concerns through class-based design.
- Comprehensive use of docstring comments for better understanding and maintainability of the code.
